Should do:
. Chapter on Adding a constructor to do something with globals.
. Chapter on DSLs

argument(type, name, [optional, mandatory]) {
  "-a", "Help text", [default], [arg_assert(exp)]
};

Would be nice:
. Further Readings
. More background info at beginnings of chapters
. Main text -> Larger font. Code -> smaller font.
